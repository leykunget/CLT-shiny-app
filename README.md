# Central Limit Theorem (CLT) Shiny App Demo

This interactive **Shiny** app illustrates the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) through a dynamic histogram. 
The CLT states that the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the original distribution.
The app, built with the **shiny** and **bslib** R packages, helps visualize this convergence.
